# rock-paper-scissors

---HOW TO PLAY THE GAME---
    1. The game starts when you press any buttons from rock, paper or scissors
    2. The first one to reach a score of 5, wins the game. An alert box pop up will appear after that.
    3. The game restarts after pressing the close button from the alert box.



Things that I have learned:
    1. Learned how to dynamically change src attribute of an img in Javascript according to a certain condition.
    2. Create an alert box using html and css.
    3. Rotate images using degrees and its Y or X axis.
    4. Disable or undisplay elements from Javascript.




Challenges faced throughout the project:
    1. Window.alert() method shows up faster than any other code having higher precedence on the source code. After scsanning through Stackoverflow, I realized that it is afterall discouraged to be used.
